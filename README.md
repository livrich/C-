# Overview

My goal was to learn the basics of C#.  For a simple project, the first thing I thought of was rock paper scissors.

My first task was to set up a wokring environment for C#.  I followed what the internet recommended and then tried to run a simple Hello World program.  It didn't work.  I spent a lot of time trying to fix how I set up my environment just to realize I was incorrectly running the Hello World program from the command line.  Haha, whoops.  Once I make the C# file into an executable file and then ran that file, everything worked perfectly.  Turns out I actually set everything up right, I just wasn't calling things correctly.  In the future, before trying to fix the enviroment for a new language that isn't working, I'm going to make sure I'm calling the code correctly first.

After getting Hello World to run, I thought the next thing to do was read documentaion and go through some basic tutorials.  Fairly quickly, I became bored of the slow moving tutorials.  If I wasn't on a deadline, I wouldn't mind going through some of the better tutorials I found.  I ended up skipping the rest of the tutorials and documentation reading.  Instead, I decided to jump right into coding rock paper scissors.

I would work until I needed to learn another concept, like how to make a loop.  Then I would typically turn to w3schools to read how to do something or Google an answer if w3schools didn't mention a specific concept.  By doing this, it only took me a few hours to get rock paper scissors working.  I tested my code as I went, but added some extra error handling that I tested at the end.  I then added some extra comments and called it good.  Right now, the game runs without any problems and helped me learn the basics of C# that I would like to apply to a more challenging project at some point.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

Overall, I think my rock paper scissors game is working well. With C# in general, I would like to:
* Figure out how to use the one line conditional statements
* Learn how to implement more classes between multiple files
* If possible, have input be entered on the same line as the question that was asked
* Implement lists and for loops in another project
